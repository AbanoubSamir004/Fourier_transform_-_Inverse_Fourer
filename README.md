# Fourier Transform & Inverse Fourier Transform

This repository contains code for analyzing a complex signal created by combining three different sine waves using the Fourier Transform and Inverse Fourier Transform from scratch. and using a Nyquist approach to determine the maximum frequency that can be accurately represented in the signal.
